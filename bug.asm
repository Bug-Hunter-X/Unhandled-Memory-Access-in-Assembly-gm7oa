mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `[ebx+esi*4+0x10]`.  The bug arises when the calculated address falls outside the bounds of allocated memory. This can lead to a segmentation fault or other unpredictable behavior.  The problem is that there's no check to ensure the address is valid before accessing it.
